# **HUB** :
I is a broadcasting device or even called a dumb device which does not gather information and input in one port results as an output in all ports on the network

# **SWITCH**:
A switch is a networking device that performs the same job as the hub but are considered as a more intelligent hub as it gathers information about the data packets it receives and forwards it to only the network that it was intended for.
